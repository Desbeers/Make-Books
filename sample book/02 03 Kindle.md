# The not so kind `Kindle`

Amazon has its own format for digital books. The whole reading world support ePubs, except Amazon. Normally, I don’t care, however, Amazons reader is pretty populair so I gave it a try.

I sincerely hate it! The software they provide is ugly; for sure not made with macOS in mind. Further; I just don’t get it. A “Previewer” that can export “old formats” when importing my ePubs. A “Creator” that only imports `docx`... And I’m not completely stupid; I know how to use good software. Their stuff is a mess...

For now, you can use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) to convert the ePub my system makes. It seems to work. I don’t have a `Kindle` but tried it with their macOS and iOS reader applications. Ugly as hell too... It works; not as good as I would like, but as good as good can be.

Now I understand that Amazon want to protect their business; making your own format will “lock you in”. Fair deal; we all have to make money. However; it would be nice if they _also_ support standards; that is not too much to ask. Even Apple does that, an ultimate proof that it is possible, hahaha!

I had to change my font for `drop caps` and made my CSS “more stupid”. Thanks Amazon...

It is pissing me off; yes it really does.
