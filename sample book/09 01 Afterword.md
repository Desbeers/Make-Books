# Afterword {.backmatter}

Well, that was all the fun! There is actually no real *afterword*. This page just exists because because it shows the possibility to say something at the end of your book.

The only thing I might have to say is that this is my first Github project; learning bit by bit. It is not my first contribution to Open Source projects, however, it is my first “project”. Hope it is useful for anyone and I promise to try to be a good maintainer of this project. I have a lot of fun with it and I hope you have some fun with it too!

Well, that’s it!
