# A real macOS application

Remember that folder named `/xcode` that I donâ€™t really want to talk about? It is not the Automator Application and Workflow that I was talking about. No no, this is the Real Deal. A real macOS application written in `SwiftUI`. However, it is just a front-end for the scripts not a standalone application. The "Catalina" version is not updated anymore, I moved to "Big Sur" only.


This frontend works great if all goes well, haha! If the scripts fail for whatever reason you will not know why... Then there is no other option than to go back to the command line... That's where the real magic happens...
