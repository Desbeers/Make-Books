# Compiling your book

#image

Compiling the book will be done on the command line with the `make-book` command, followed by some optional arguments.

You have to be in the folder containing the book. A picture says  more than thousand words, so please have a look:

If you run `make-book` without any argument it will give you a PDF and an ePub in the export folder. The optional arguments for the `make-book` command are the following:

## Clean the export folder: **clean**

This is a special command. It’s doesn’t create anything. Even the opposite; it will *clean* whatever book might have been compiled in the past and is still in the export folder. Don’t worry; it will not get even close to your writing stuff!
Please note; the script, or more precisely, the Make program, is smart. It will know when you have changed something in your book and will always grap *the latest and greatest* files. So, there is no need to *clean* for that reason.

## Output formats: **pdf**, **print**, **epub**, **kobo**

Just put any type you want to compile as argument. You can add as many as you like at the same time and order does not matter.

A few notes about the export formats:

### **pdf** & **print**

> They are basically the same. The only difference is that `pdf` will have the (optional) cover included and has a slightly coloured background while `print` will never have a cover and is just plain white. That makes the `print` file more suitable for uploading to a POD service for example. Also, `print` does not have coloured hyperlinks; even thought the links are still working.

### **epub** & **kobo**

> An `epub` is, you might have guessed it, an ePub! An `kobo` is also an ePub, however, optimised for the Kobo reader.

### **tex** (LaTeX format)

> It will be the complete `tex` file but I’m pretty sure you will not be able to compile it with any other software. The file will be stuffed with dependancies on this build-system and your images will be completely forgotten...
