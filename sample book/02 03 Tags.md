# Compiling tags collections

Another script in the `/terminal` folder is `make-tag-book`. It’s ment to make a book, containing any tag found in all your source files.

---

Same as with *collection* books, this kind of book needs a slightly different `make-book.md`. For “tag books”, it is called `make-tag-book`. All the other files in the folder are just the same.

---

This is where you define your `tag`. It still needs the other tags as well, of course. Name, title, etcetera.

	---
	tag: #favorite
	---
	
It actually just search each and every file for whatever you define as the tag. It doesn’t have to be a specific `#` word.
	
---
	
Thats all. Make sure you are in the folder of your `make-tag-book.md` and enter the following command in the terminal:

	make-tag-book pdf epub
	
The arguments are again just like when you are making a normal book. You can make a collection in any kind of format that you can make your normal books.

## Make all tags

Just as with the `make-all-books` we also have a `make-all-tags` in the `/terminal` folder. It behaves exactly the same as well.
