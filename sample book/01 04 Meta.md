# Metadata for your book

#image

Every book has a `make-book.md` file in the `/assets` subfolder of your book; providing the metadata for the book. It’s just plain text and without this file, the book will not be created. For the nerdy people: it’s actually a `yaml` format file.

The order of the tags does not matter.

## Chapter styles

Normally, chapters look like this:

![](images/chapter-header.png){width=85%}

For books that have numbered chapters by itself, like *Chapter 1*, it looks a bit ugly. If you set the `chapter-style: plain`, the number and line above the chapter name will be removed.

Any other chapter style provided by the LaTeX *Memoir* class can be used for PDF output. For ePub output, there is no style provided in the CSS file, besides for the standard style and `plain`.

## Paper and font options

As I described in the *configuration* page; all options are coming from the LaTeX Memoir class. Have a look over there if you skipped that chapter...

## Revision

This does not really *do* anything. Whatever you set here will literarily be dropped on the copyright page.

## Collections

The `collection` related tags are not the “official ePub3” standards for grouping your books into *series*; it is only ment for building your "collection book".

The `add-to-collection` tag is used by the `make-collection` and `make-all-collections` build-scripts to create one *collection book* out of the other books who have the same `add-to-collection` tag. The collection itself is defined with `collection`. I will explain that later.

## All the rest

The `make-book.md` file is just a part of the Pandoc possibilities, so, anything that Pandoc supports can be in this file. In theory... Lot’s of Pandoc options are set by the build-scripts so they might conflict with each other. According the manual, the command line, so, these build-scripts, will “win” from settings in the `make-book.md` file...
