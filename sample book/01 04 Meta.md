# Metadata for your book

#image

Every book has a `make-book.md` file in the `/assets` subfolder of your book; providing the metadata for the book. It’s just plain text and without this file, the book will not be created. For the nerdy people: it’s actually a `yaml` format file.

The order of the tags does not matter.

## Chapter styles

Normally, chapters look like this:

![](images/chapter-header.png){width=85%}

For books that have numbered chapters by itself, like *Chapter 1*, it looks a bit ugly. If you set the `chapter-style: plain`, the number and line above the chapter name will be removed.

Any other chapter style provided by the LaTeX *Memoir* class can be used for PDF output. For ePub output, there is no style provided in the CSS file, besides for the standard style and `plain`.

## Paper and font options

As I described in the *configuration* page; all options are coming from the LaTeX Memoir class. Have a look over there if you skipped that chapter...

## Revision

This does not really *do* anything. Whatever you set here will literarily be dropped on the copyright page.

## Collections

The `collections` related tags have no function for the output of the book. They are not yet supported by Pandoc. I hope tat will come in the future; it is [requested](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6199) on Github. The tags are “official ePub3” standards and programs like Calibre supports it. Apple’s Books unfortunately not; as always has Apple its own mind about “standards”...

For now, the tags are used by the `make-collection` and `make-all-collections` build-scripts to create one *collection book* out of the other books who have the same `belongs-to-collection` tag. I will explain that later.

## All the rest

The `make-book.md` file is just a part of the Pandoc possibilities, so, anything that Pandoc supports can be in this file. In theory... Lot’s of Pandoc options are set by the build-scripts so they might conflict with each other. According the manual, the command line, so, these build-scripts, will “win” from settings in the `make-book.md` file...
