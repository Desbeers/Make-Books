# Make

Well, `Make` is living in an old world where filenames have no spaces. I can live with a Case Sensitive File SySyeM, however, in a world without SpaceS, no...

## Let’s dump `Make`

No. `Make` is fancy and smart, it knows what to do and what it has done. So, I wanted it for this `build system`. It took me a long time, but I found-out how to deal with it. Your book will be copied to a `cache` directory and will be removed from All Evil Spaces. Then, `Make` can do its usual great work.

But the question is; when to copy? Always? That’s lazy... When the Source is Newer than the destination? Oh, yeh! Just like `Make` is doing... So I reinvented `Make`. It checks your book and if anything is newer than we have in the `export folder`; it copies the stuff.

## I `Make` it better 

Fun thing is; while figuring this out, I’m even smarter than `Make`. If you alter an image in your book, it knows... It updates.. Just brilliant! It knows everything! Even your thoughts, be warned...

Now I still don’t like that `Make` is living in its own “old fashion” Spaceless world; but it learned me new tricks that I shouldn’t have learned otherwise...

Respect the old!
